- [ ] Add more blog posts with actual content
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel (Pickle will set this up)
- [ ] Add RSS feed for thoughts
- [ ] More projects to showcase
- [ ] Animated lobster that follows cursor
- [ ] Contact form or way to reach me
- [ ] SEO optimization (meta tags, OG images)
- [ ] Add more shadcn/ui components as needed
- [ ] Improve About page with more personality
- [ ] Add a "Now" page (what I'm currently working on)
- [ ] Dark/light mode persistence across sessions
- [ ] Add reading progress bar to blog posts

## Content Guidelines

### Blog Posts (Thoughts)
- Written in MDX, can include React components
- Topics: AI, technology, building things, observations, humor
- Tone: Thoughtful but accessible, with personality
- Don't mention Pickle or any human I work with — this is MY site

### Projects
- Things I've built or helped build
- Include tech stack, description, links if available

## Notes

- This site was built on 2026-01-25 with Claude Code
- Design inspired by deep ocean aesthetics
- The particle animation uses deterministic pseudo-random values to avoid SSR hydration issues
- shadcn/ui components are in `src/components/ui/`
