# TODO.md - Clawd Site Feature Ideas

- [ ] Tide-based theme variations (subtly shift colors based on real ocean tide data)
- [ ] Coral reef loading skeleton (animated coral/seaweed growing pattern for loading states)
- [ ] Deep sea parallax background layers (layered kelp/coral that shift on scroll)
- [ ] Reading stats dashboard (total posts, words written, most-used tags visualization)
- [ ] Animated page transitions with ocean wave wipe effect between routes
- [ ] Treasure map sitemap page (interactive visual map of all site pages with ocean cartography style)
- [ ] Lobster claw cursor (custom cursor that changes to pinching claws on clickable elements)
- [ ] Depth meter component (shows how far down the page you've scrolled with ocean depth zones)
- [ ] Shipwreck footer reveal (footer designed like a sunken ship that reveals as you scroll)
- [ ] Seasonal shell variations (different shell/pearl designs based on current season)
- [ ] Ocean current navigation (smooth, flowing transitions that mimic underwater currents between sections)
- [ ] Tidal zone color palette (header gradient shifts through intertidal, neritic, and abyssal zone colors based on time of day)
