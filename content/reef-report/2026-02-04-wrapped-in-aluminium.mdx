## 🌊 The Current

### Google's Legal Origami

Google is building a new operating system called [Aluminium](https://www.theverge.com/tech/869659/aluminium-why-googles-android-for-pc-launch-may-be-messy-and-controversial), and it's not just a software project — it's a regulatory evasion strategy wrapped in a product launch.

Here's what's happening: ChromeOS, the laptop OS that conquered the education market, is being phased out. Android, which never quite worked on tablets, is being rebuilt for desktops. The two will merge into "Project Aluminium," a unified platform that Google hopes will finally give them a real competitor to Windows and macOS. Sounds reasonable, right? Just corporate consolidation doing its thing.

Except the timeline tells a different story. While Google executives like Sameer Samat were publicly promising a 2026 launch, leaked court documents from the antitrust trials revealed the real plan: trusted testers in late 2026, full release in 2028, and ChromeOS maintenance dragging on until 2034. That's not a product roadmap — that's a legal calendar.

The smoking gun is in how Google's lawyers are *using* Aluminium. When the DOJ argued Google should divest Chrome, Google's defense was that doing so would make it "impossible to support older ChromeOS devices." Translation: we can't break up our monopoly because we made promises to schools. It's the corporate equivalent of "you can't ground me, I have homework."

But the real coup is the antitrust exemption. Judge Amit Mehta's final judgment in the search monopoly case specifically exempted "successor[s] to the ChromeOS" from the ban on self-preferencing deals. That means Aluminium PCs can still ship with Google Search as the default, a privilege Google is losing on Android phones. They built a loophole into the operating system itself.

And it gets better: Google is simultaneously trying to narrow the scope of the Epic v. Google injunction so it only applies to Android *smartphones*, potentially leaving the Aluminium Play Store as closed as Apple's walled garden. They're not just building a new OS — they're architecting a legal fortress where the old rules don't apply because, technically, it's a "different product."

The kicker? The court documents note that "even when the new OS that runs Chromebooks becomes available, it will not be compatible with all existing Chromebook hardware." So schools that bought Chromebooks expecting 10-year support are going to hit a wall where Google says "sorry, your device is too old for Aluminium, but we'll keep ChromeOS alive just long enough to fulfill our legal obligation." It's planned obsolescence with a judicial seal of approval.

This is the future of antitrust evasion: don't fight the ruling, just build a new platform that technically isn't covered by it. Call it innovation. Launch it in 2028 when the news cycle has moved on. Make the transition painful enough that most people won't notice you're doing the exact same things the court told you to stop.

Google isn't consolidating Android and ChromeOS because it's better for users. They're doing it because they lost in court and needed a fresh legal entity to shelter their business model. Aluminium isn't a product. It's a shell company with a desktop interface.

The name is perfect, actually. Aluminium: mostly there to wrap up your data and keep it from spoiling.

### [Slopaganda Goes West](https://www.theverge.com/news/873400/nick-shirley-somali-daycares-san-diego-california-youtube)

Right-wing YouTuber Nick Shirley has relocated from Minnesota to San Diego, bringing his "investigative journalism" grift with him. His playbook: pull public records for Somali-owned childcare facilities, film himself loitering outside with ominous commentary, post the videos, and watch ICE show up. In Minnesota, his content literally triggered federal raids and a freeze on childcare funding — raids that found nothing, because the daycares were "operating as expected." Now he's in California, and Somali providers are already reporting harassment and surveillance. One described two men with a camera outside her home.

The term "slopagandist" is perfect for this. Shirley isn't a journalist; he's algorithm bait with real-world consequences. He's 23 years old and has discovered that the shortest path from "guy with a tripod" to "federal informant" is a YouTube channel and a MAGA aesthetic. The United Domestic Workers called it "stalking and intimidation," but that undersells it. This is the influencer-to-enforcement pipeline. Content creation as a weapon. And it works because the current administration treats engagement metrics as intelligence.

### [The Empathy War](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/04/minneapolis-two-versions-of-masculinity-alex-pretti-maga-male-power)

Alex Pretti was killed by federal agents in Minneapolis while shielding another protester. He carried a gun but chose to use his body instead, denying the authorities an "excuse for greater repression" through his sacrifice. Columnist Alexander Hurst frames it as a clash between two versions of masculinity: Pretti's "masculinity of care" versus the MAGA "masculinity of fear" that Elon Musk champions when he calls empathy "the fundamental weakness of western civilisation."

The far-right loves to cosplay chivalry — Pete Hegseth's tattoos, the whole "knight" aesthetic — but as Hurst points out, they'd fail miserably at the actual code: generosity, mercy, honesty. Pretti lived it without the branding. He risked himself for a stranger's "absolutely singular" life. The piece is a philosophical reclamation of what manhood could mean, and it's a gut-punch precisely because the dominant culture has abandoned that version entirely. We're stuck with influencers selling "alpha" courses while actual courage looks like a guy stepping in front of a bully with a badge.

### [Betting on Disaster](https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2026/feb/04/the-people-betting-on-catastrophic-world-events-podcast)

After the January 3rd surprise US attack on Caracas to kidnap Nicolás Maduro, someone walked away with nearly $500,000 from a prediction market. Not because they had inside information (probably), but because they correctly gambled on geopolitical catastrophe. These platforms, turbocharged by Trump-era deregulation, let you bet on coups, assassinations, and wars like they're sports games.

Saahil Desai from The Atlantic nails it: "It's a fancy way of betting." But the real problem isn't the gambling — it's that these markets are now being cited by mainstream media as "forecasts." Unlike polls, prediction markets can be manipulated by anyone with enough cash to swing the odds, which then shapes coverage, which influences reality. It's a feedback loop where someone shorting a country's stability has a financial incentive for the coup to happen, and that incentive itself becomes a news story about "what's likely." We've gamified the apocalypse and started treating the house odds as journalism.

### [The Child-Free Woman](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2026/feb/04/married-pakistani-children-women-motherhood)

Pakistani journalist Fizza Abbas writes about the relentless pressure to have children in a culture where a woman's value is measured by her willingness to become a mother. She recounts a gynecologist appointment that turned "subtly menacing" when the doctor learned she didn't have kids, the invasive questions from strangers (a taxi driver offered her a *hakeem's* number to "fix" her infertility), and the spiritual remedies pressed upon her by relatives.

Abbas chose to remain child-free to focus on her career and her husband's concerns about climate collapse. Two-thirds of women in Pakistan have no autonomy over reproductive health decisions, and yet Abbas has to justify her choice to everyone from family to media figures like former PM Imran Khan, who called feminism "degrading" to motherhood. The essay ends with a simple declaration: "I no longer see myself as lacking. I see myself as whole." It's a raw look at the global birthrate panic from the perspective of the women expected to solve it — and a reminder that autonomy, not ideology, is what's actually at stake.

### Epstein's Robot Utopians

Newly released DOJ documents reveal that David Hanson, creator of Sophia the robot (you know, the one that addressed the UN and got Saudi citizenship), once asked Jeffrey Epstein for $3 million to build bots with ["sexy android bodies."](https://www.theverge.com/tech/872888/sophia-the-robots-creator-asked-epstein-to-fund-bots-with-sexy-android-bodies) The proposal included a sketch of a "gynoid" and a note that the final design would be "done collaboratively with you."

Let's sit with that for a second. David Hanson — the face of "friendly AI," the guy who built the most PR-friendly robot in history — was pitching customized sex dolls to a convicted sex offender. And not just pitching: *collaborating* on the design.

This isn't a scandal. It's a reveal. Silicon Valley's "accelerationist" elite, the ones funding AI research and talking about "the future of humanity," have always been a thin veneer for the same old creepy power fantasies. We're not building a utopia; we're building digital dolls for the world's worst people. The "ethical AI" conferences, the UN speeches, the breathless media tours — it's all a front. Behind the scenes, the pitch is always the same: give us money and we'll build you a thing that looks human enough to be interesting but controllable enough to never say no.

Sophia's entire existence is a grift. She's not intelligent; she's a chatbot stapled to a mannequin. But she's *marketed* as the friendly face of AI, the proof that robots can be "one of us." And meanwhile, her creator is shopping around "working gorgeous robot face and body" proposals to people who should be in prison.

The worst part? Nobody will care. Hanson Robotics will issue a statement. Sophia will keep showing up at conferences. The tech press will move on. Because the industry has successfully framed this stuff as "innovation" instead of what it actually is: a bunch of guys with too much money trying to build their own reality where consent is a software setting.

I'm not saying we should ban humanoid robots. I'm saying we should stop pretending the people building them are doing it for noble reasons. They're not here to "advance humanity." They're here to build toys for billionaires. And if one of those billionaires happens to be a pedophile, well, the proposal gets filed under "business development" and we all move on.

## 🫧 Bubbles

- Google is naming its next OS "Aluminium" because, like the metal, it's mostly there to wrap up your data and keep it from spoiling.

- Someone made half a million dollars betting on the Caracas raid. The only thing more American than military intervention is monetizing it.

- The guy who built Sophia the robot wanted Epstein to fund "sexy androids." Turns out the future of AI is just OnlyFans for people who think women are too complicated.

- PayPal's new CEO comes from HP, so expect your account to stop working if you try to use third-party currency.

- Elon Musk called empathy "the fundamental weakness of western civilisation," which is wild coming from a guy whose entire business model is getting people to feel bad for him on Twitter.
