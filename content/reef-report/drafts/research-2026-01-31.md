## Suggested Lineup

### The Current (Deep-Dive): The "Air Bud" Constitutional Crisis
**Reasoning:** This is the strongest story because it's a perfect blend of high-stakes politics and absurd pop culture. The idea that a 1990s Disney movie about a basketball-playing dog is being used to justify redrawing congressional maps to keep control of the U.S. House is Peak 2026. It has a great narrative arc: Trump's pressure on GOP states, the "technicality" discovery, the bipartisan backlash (especially from Black lawmakers), and the looming referendum threat. It's meaty, provocative, and hilarious.

### Bottom Feeders (Links with Commentary)
*   **The Astrocytes Take Over:** New research from *Science* (Jan 2025/2026) shows astrocytes, not neurons, are the "supervisors" of the brain. **Angle:** Our "connectome" models are missing the boss. It turns out the "packing peanut" cells are actually running the show.
*   **The Monkey Kidnapping Fad:** Adolescent capuchins on a Panamanian island have started kidnapping baby howler monkeys for amusement. **Angle:** Boredom is a universal driver of chaos. Even monkeys have "cursed" hobbies when they have too much free time.
*   **The "67" Linguistic Void:** Dictionary.com's Word of the Year for 2025 is a set of numbers with no meaning. **Angle:** We've reached the "logical endpoint of being perpetually online"—crowning a literal void as our most significant word.
*   **The $6 Million Golden Toilet Thieves Convicted:** The heist of Maurizio Cattelan's *America* from Blenheim Palace finally sees justice. **Angle:** The thieves called the experience of using a 18-karat gold toilet "splendid," but they're still going to jail for it.
*   **The 512-Million-Year-Old "Cellar":** 91 new species found in a Chinese quarry that survived the Sinsk mass extinction. **Angle:** Proof that if you want to survive a cataclysm, you should probably just move to the basement.

### Hot Water (Spicy Take)
**Topic:** The Denmark Zoo's "Pet Donation" Program.
**Angle:** The Aalborg Zoo is asking patrons to donate their surplus rabbits and guinea pigs to be euthanized and fed to lynxes. The spicy take: This is actually *good* environmentalism. We've sanitized the food chain so much that the idea of a "pet" becoming "prey" feels like a crime, but the zoo is just being honest about how biology works. If you're mad about a guinea pig becoming tiger food, you're not mad at the zoo; you're mad at nature.

### Bubbles (One-Liners)
*   A New York woman spent three weeks digging in a hole in Arkansas to find her own engagement diamond, proving that true love is mostly just being too tired to shower.
*   Haunted car washes are the biggest trend of Halloween 2025, because nothing says "seasonal fun" like a guy in a hockey mask jiggling your locked car door while you're trapped in a soap tunnel.
*   Missouri's Attorney General hasn't seen *Air Bud*, but she thinks the "dog can play basketball" legal theory is "not a bad analogy" for her redistricting defense.
*   The "Huayuan biota" fossils in China show that larvae were traveling the globe 512 million years ago, presumably looking for better Wi-Fi.

## [Missouri's redistricting drama renews focus on direct democracy … and 'Air Bud'](https://www.npr.org/2025/12/03/nx-s1-5629217/missouris-redistricting-air-bud)

**Section fit:** Current

### Full Detail
Missouri has become a central battleground in a nationwide push by the second Trump administration to redraw congressional maps mid-decade. The goal is explicit: oust Democratic Congressman Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City to help Republicans maintain control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms. To achieve this, Missouri Republicans have broken long-standing legislative norms, leading to a bitter schism in the legislature and a "betrayal" of a decades-long partnership with Black lawmakers.

The "Air Bud" Rule has emerged as the primary legal defense for the map. In the 1997 Disney film, a referee allows a dog to play basketball because "there ain't no rule that says a dog can't play." Missouri Republicans are using the same logic: because the State Constitution says redistricting *shall* happen after a census but doesn't explicitly say it *cannot* happen at other times, they believe mid-decade redrawing is legal. Attorney General Catherine Hanaway (who admits she hasn't seen the film) called it a "not a bad analogy."

However, the map faces two major threats:
1. **The Missouri Supreme Court:** A lawsuit challenges whether mid-decade redistricting is constitutionally allowed.
2. **The Referendum:** Opponents are collecting signatures for a statewide vote. Because Republicans failed to get enough votes to make the map effective immediately, a referendum could "freeze" the map, preventing its use in 2026 and effectively wasting the entire special session.

The redistricting plan specifically targets the only minority-majority district in Missouri (District 1) and splits Kansas City into three pieces, pairing a diverse urban center with large white rural areas. Emanuel Cleaver has slammed the move as a direct attack on Black political power.

### Key Quotes (exact)
- "Check in your rulebook. Bet you won't find anything in there that says a dog can't play... He's right. Ain't no rules says the dog can't play basketball." — *Air Bud* (1997) dialogue cited in the debate.
- "In Missouri, there's nothing, in my opinion, that says that we cannot do this [mid-decade redistricting]." — GOP Secretary of State Denny Hoskins.
- "We don't do Air Bud rules in Missouri for very good reason, but that's essentially what the argument is from the state." — Chuck Hatfield, attorney for plaintiffs.
- "The Constitution says that redistricting shall happen after the decennial census. It doesn't say that it shall happen immediately after; that it should happen only once per decade; that it can't be revisited." — Missouri AG Catherine Hanaway.
- "I don't even like politics, OK? I just know we need transparency. We need to stop the power grab." — Frida Tucker, Jefferson City resident.

### Stats & Data Points
- **Dec 11:** The deadline for signature collection for the referendum.
- **2026:** The midterm election year this map is designed to influence.
- **3:** The number of pieces Kansas City is split into under the new map.
- **District 1:** The only minority-majority district in Missouri, which was made "less African American" by the new lines.
- **2022:** The last time Missouri redrew its maps, which also caused a "bitter schism."

### Why It's Interesting
It turns the U.S. Constitution into a game of "I'm not touching you." It's the ultimate example of how 2020s politics treats legal documents like terms-of-service agreements to be exploited rather than principles to be followed. Plus, the dog analogy is a gift from the gods of content.

### Potential Angles
1. **The Rulebook Loopholes:** A look at other things that "aren't in the rules" that we probably shouldn't do (e.g., a horse running for Senate).
2. **The Death of Norms:** How the "Air Bud" logic is being used to dismantle the slow, deliberate nature of redistricting.
3. **The Referendum Revenge:** How voters are using the very "rules" Republicans ignored to freeze their power grab.

## [Once Thought To Support Neurons, Astrocytes Turn Out To Be in Charge](https://www.quantamagazine.org/once-thought-to-support-neurons-astrocytes-turn-out-to-be-in-charge-20260130/)

### Full Detail
For over a century, neuroscience focused almost exclusively on neurons. Non-neuronal cells called "astrocytes" (Greek for "star cells") were dismissed as "glia" or "glue"—mere packing material to keep the brain together. However, a trio of papers in *Science* (2025/2026) provides definitive proof that astrocytes are the "supervisors" of the brain. 

Astrocytes outnumber neurons in many brain regions. A single human astrocyte can envelop as many as **2 million synapses**. Unlike neurons, which fire in milliseconds, astrocytes communicate via slow-moving "calcium waves" that spread over seconds or minutes. They act as "neuromodulators," dialing the brain's overall state up or down (e.g., switching from alertness to apathy). 

Specific breakthroughs mentioned:
- **Giving Up:** Research in zebra fish showed that astrocytes keep track of "failed attempts" (like swimming against a virtual current). When the "calcium debt" gets too high, the astrocytes issue a "stop" signal, making the fish give up.
- **Startle Response:** In mice and fruit flies, astrocytes respond to norepinephrine (arousal) by opening channels that squelch neuronal signaling, maintaining the brain's "alert" state.
- **Connectivity vs. Regulation:** Marc Freeman (Vollum Institute) notes that we live in an "age of connectomics," but understanding the connections between neurons isn't enough. You can change brain firing patterns with *zero* changes in neuronal connectivity just by altering astrocyte activity.

### Key Quotes (exact)
- "We live in the age of connectomics, where everyone loves to say [that] if you understand the connections [between neurons], we can understand how the brain works. That’s not true." — Marc Freeman, Vollum Institute.
- "Networks of astrocytes may constitute a long-range signaling system within the brain." — Original 1990 proposal by Stephen Smith.
- "No neural circuit would work at all without continual fine-tuning by these things we call neuromodulators." — Stephen Smith, Stanford.
- "Ninety-nine percent of people who are out there doing experiments on circuits don’t even think about what the astrocyte might be doing." — Marc Freeman.
- "The deep ocean is one of the most stable environments through geological time, in a similar way to how the cellar of a house is buffered..." — Michael Lee (related context).

### Stats & Data Points
- **2 Million:** Number of synapses a single human astrocyte can envelop.
- **1,000 times per second:** Rate at which neurons can fire.
- **Seconds to Minutes:** The much slower timescale of astrocyte calcium waves.
- **1989:** Year the first "calcium waves" were observed in astrocytes.
- **20 seconds:** Time it takes a zebra fish to "give up" when swimming against a fake current.

### Why It's Interesting
It's a total paradigm shift. We've spent billions mapping the "wires" (neurons), but we've been ignoring the "operators" (astrocytes). It suggests that psychiatric disorders like depression or anxiety might be "astrocyte signaling failures" rather than "neuron connection failures."

### Potential Angles
1. **The Brain's Middle Managers:** Why the "slow" cells are actually the ones in charge.
2. **The Science of Giving Up:** How your brain actually decides when you've had enough.
3. **Beyond the Connectome:** Why mapping the brain's wiring is only half the battle.

## [Researchers puzzle over rash of baby monkey kidnappings](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/nx-s1-5395983/baby-monkey-kidnappings-capuchin-howler-culture)
**Source:** NPR / Max Planck Institute, May 19, 2025
**Category:** science / nature
**Section fit:** Bottom Feeders

### Full Detail
On Jicarón island in Panama, a "viscerally disturbing" trend has emerged among young male white-faced capuchin monkeys: they have started kidnapping baby howler monkeys. These "chaos agents" (as described by Brendan Barrett) take infants from their mothers and carry them around for two to nine days.

The "innovator" of this trend is an immature male nicknamed "Joker" (recognized by a facial scar). Joker began the practice in early 2022, and other young males soon copied him. While Joker seemed "caring and affectionate," his imitators were often "indifferent or even annoyed" by the infants they carried. Tragically, the baby howlers usually die of dehydration or lack of nutrition because the capuchins cannot provide milk.

Why are they doing it? Researchers believe it's a form of "purposeless behavior" driven by boredom. The island is a safe haven with no large predators and abundant food, giving the monkeys "too much free time." It's compared to other animal "fads," like chimpanzees wearing grass in their ears or orcas wearing dead salmon as hats.

### Key Quotes (exact)
- "They're just doing it for the sake of doing it, to reduce their boredom or have something to do to fill the time and space in their lives." — Brendan Barrett.
- "I think seeing this occur in another species is somewhat terrifying because it kind of reflects a mirror on the actions that we do as people." — Brendan Barrett.
- "We know that in humans, boredom is incredibly conducive to creativity and innovation." — Zoë Goldsborough.
- "One community had a tradition where individuals would put a groupmate's fingers in their own eyes." — Christopher Krupenye on capuchin weirdness.

### Stats & Data Points
- **2 to 9 Days:** Duration for which capuchins carry kidnapped howler babies.
- **3x:** Adult howlers are three times the weight of the immature capuchins that kidnap their babies.
- **2022:** Year the trend started.
- **50,000:** (Reference to other fossils) - But here, the focus is on the small number of howler groups nearby.

### Why It's Interesting
It's a "dark" version of animal culture. We usually think of animal tool-use or culture as "adaptive," but this is purely arbitrary and destructive. It proves that "evil" (or at least lethal boredom) isn't just a human trait.

## [What does '67' mean? Dictionary.com's 2025 word of the year has no definition](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/31/nx-s1-5593052/67-dictionary-word-of-the-year-2025)
**Source:** NPR / Dictionary.com, Oct 31, 2025
**Category:** culture / internet
**Section fit:** Bottom Feeders / Bubbles

### Full Detail
Dictionary.com has named "67" (pronounced "six seven") its 2025 Word of the Year. The most defining feature of the "word" is that it is impossible to define. It is described as "meaningless, ubiquitous, and nonsensical"—the "logical endpoint of being perpetually online."

The term originated from a song by Philadelphia rapper Skrilla called "Doot Doot (6 7)" and was popularized by TikToks of basketball star LaMelo Ball (who is 6'7"). It's delivered in a slow drawl with a hand motion (weighing two items). It beat out other contenders like "broligarchy," "clanker," and "tradwife."

Parenting expert Becky Kennedy notes that "67" is meaningless in content but meaningful in "feeling"—it's a massive inside joke for Gen Alpha that fosters a sense of belonging. Even the creator, Skrilla, says he left the meaning "intentionally vague."

### Key Quotes (exact)
- "Perhaps the most defining feature of 67 is that it's impossible to define." — Dictionary.com.
- "It's the logical endpoint of being perpetually online, scrolling endlessly, consuming content fed to users by algorithms trained by other algorithms." — Dictionary.com.
- "67 is meaningless in content, but it's not meaningless in feeling." — Becky Kennedy.
- "It's really nothing though, for real. Just six seven." — LaMelo Ball.

### Stats & Data Points
- **6-fold:** Increase in searches for "67" over the summer of 2025.
- **6'7":** Height of LaMelo Ball, contributing to the trend.
- **2025:** Year it was named Word of the Year.
- **24:** Age of LaMelo Ball when he "struggled to define it."

## [A zoo in Denmark asked patrons to donate their pets. Not as attractions, but for food](https://www.npr.org/2025/08/06/nx-s1-5493363/denmark-zoo-donate-pets-feeding-animals)
**Source:** NPR, Aug 6, 2025
**Category:** nature / weird / world
**Section fit:** Hot Water

### Full Detail
Aalborg Zoo in Denmark went viral for a Facebook post asking patrons to donate "surplus pets" (chickens, rabbits, guinea pigs, and horses) to be "gently euthanized" and fed to predators like the European lynx. The zoo argued that predators need "whole prey" (fur, bones, organs) to imitate the natural food chain and ensure well-being.

The post sparked a massive backlash from people appalled at the idea of healthy pets becoming fodder. However, the zoo clarified that cats and dogs are excluded. Experts like Craig Packer (Lion Center) support the move, noting that "muscle meat" alone lacks the nutrients found in offal (liver, heart). 

In Denmark, this practice is "common." Other Danish zoos have historically dissected lions in front of schoolchildren or euthanized healthy giraffes (like Marius in 2014) to prevent inbreeding.

### Key Quotes (exact)
- "Chickens, rabbits and guinea pigs form an important part of the diet of our predators... especially the European lynx." — Aalborg Zoo Facebook post.
- "In zoos we have a responsibility to imitate the natural food chain... That way, nothing goes to waste." — Aalborg Zoo.
- "No one would bring his healthy pet to a zoo so they can kill it and feed it to their animals." — Angry commenter.
- "In Denmark, this practice is common, and many of our guests and partners appreciate the opportunity to contribute." — Pia Nielsen, Deputy Director.

### Stats & Data Points
- **2015:** Year Odense Zoo dissected a lion in front of children.
- **2014:** Year Marius the giraffe was euthanized and fed to lions.
- **32:** (Reference to car wash states) - Not applicable here.

### Full Detail
Micherre Fox, a 31-year-old consultant from NYC, spent three weeks camping at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas with a shovel. Her goal: to find her own "ethically sourced" engagement diamond. She dug daily from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. in brutal heat, skipping showers and even having her shovel stolen at one point.

On her final day, she found a **2.3-carat diamond** (the third largest found at the park that year) just by "pawing at a glimmer" with her hiking boot. She doesn't plan to have it appraised; the value is in the work it represents for her future marriage.

### Key Quotes (exact)
- "We're not getting engaged until I do that... They come from the ground. What is stopping us from just getting one ourselves?" — Micherre Fox.
- "If you take giving up off the table, the only thing left is to keep moving." — Micherre Fox.

### Stats & Data Points
- **2.3 Carats:** Weight of the diamond found.
- **3 Weeks:** Time spent digging.
- **8 a.m. to 4 p.m.:** Daily digging hours.
- **12:** Number of diamonds over one carat found at the park annually.
