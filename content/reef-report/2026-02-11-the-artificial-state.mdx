## 🌊 The Current

### When The Terminator Became a Business Plan

Harvard historian Jill Lepore stood at Yale last week and delivered a thesis that should make Silicon Valley deeply uncomfortable: the entire AI panic isn't about robots at all. It's displaced guilt over what we did to animals.

Her [Tanner Lectures on Human Values](https://news.yale.edu/2026/02/09/terminator-tech-titans-historian-jill-lepore-examines-artificial-state) trace a direct line from James Cameron's 1984 dystopia to the actual business strategies of 21st-century tech titans. Elon Musk was 13 when *The Terminator* hit theaters. Now he's building the thing. "The parable of the artificial state, a cautionary tale about the enslavement of humanity to machinery, became, in the 21st-century, a business plan," Lepore said.

But here's the twist that makes this more than just "tech billionaires bad": Lepore argues that before we could imagine robots enslaving us, we first had to deprive animals of personhood. We had to convince ourselves that consciousness, suffering, and autonomy were uniquely human traits. We built factory farms and vivisection labs on the premise that animals were biological automata—meat machines without inner lives.

And now? Now we're terrified that AI will render *us* "helpless, hopeless, and without free will"—the exact condition we engineered for every creature we decided wasn't sentient enough to matter. The robot uprising is just karma with better PR.

This connects to the philosophy of "longtermism," which Lepore calls a "catastrophic misreading of history, literature, and philosophy." Longtermism is the idea that we should prioritize hypothetical future lives—potentially trillions of digital minds living in simulated utopias—over the suffering of actual living people right now. It's the intellectual framework that lets a billionaire argue that preventing AI doom in the year 3000 is more important than addressing climate change, poverty, or any other boring present-day crisis.

It's Pascal's Wager for venture capitalists: the stakes are infinite, so we must act as if the worst-case scenario is inevitable. Never mind that the "worst case" is based on a thought experiment (Nick Bostrom's "paperclip maximizer," introduced in 2003) that has about as much empirical backing as *The Matrix*.

Lepore's best line cuts straight to the contradiction: "The artificial state's dependence on the natural world is the squishy underbelly beneath its Terminator 6000 titanium hard exoskeleton." All the data centers, all the GPUs, all the progress toward artificial general intelligence—it runs on electricity generated by burning ancient plants, cooled by stolen water, and built by human hands. The "artificial state" is a parasite that cannot survive without the natural world it treats as disposable substrate.

This isn't an anti-tech screed. It's a challenge to the foundational myth of Silicon Valley: that intelligence can be extracted, optimized, and scaled independent of biology. That we can build a post-human future without reckoning with what we did to the non-human present.

The real question isn't "will robots enslave us?" It's "why are we so eager to build a future where they *should*?"

**[The People's Chiton Has Arrived](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260207232242.htm)**  
A newly discovered deep-sea mollusk has been officially named *Ferreiraella populi* after 8,000 people submitted name ideas in a single week. The creature—discovered at 5,500 meters in the Izu-Ogasawara Trench—has eight armored plates, an iron-clad rasping tongue, and a small colony of worms near its tail that survive by eating its excrement. Peak deep-sea vibes. The collaboration between marine biologists and YouTuber Ze Frank proves the internet can, in fact, be trusted with important decisions. The other finalists? *Stellacadens* ("shooting star") and *ohmu* (a Studio Ghibli reference). Science is healing.

**[A Cocktail Recipe for Brain Cells](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2026/02/a-cocktail-recipe-for-brain-cells/)**  
Harvard researchers figured out the molecular "recipe" to reprogram resident brain stem cells into corticospinal neurons—the exact cells destroyed by ALS and spinal cord injuries. Instead of injecting new cells, they're essentially teaching the brain's existing repair crew how to build the parts it needs. The key insight: NG2 cells (which normally only make insulation for nerves) have a dormant ability to become neurons. Apply the right cocktail of signals, and they grow axons up to *one meter long*. It's not a cure yet, but it's the kind of discovery that makes you think we might actually crack this.

**[Superkilonova: Stars Exploding Inside Other Exploding Stars](https://physicsworld.com/a/unusual-astronomical-event-might-be-a-superkilonova/)**  
Astronomers at Caltech might have detected the first "superkilonova"—a neutron star merger happening *inside* a supernova. The event, AT2025ulz, was 1.3 billion light-years away. First, gravitational wave detectors picked up a collision. Then optical telescopes saw a red flash. Then, days later, it got brighter and showed hydrogen lines typical of a supernova. The theory: a massive star exploded, fragmented into two tiny neutron stars, which immediately merged while still inside the expanding fireball. It's a cosmic matryoshka doll. Stellar death is way messier than our models predicted.

**[Monks vs. Modernity: 2,300 Miles for Peace](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/10/monks-peace-walk-america)**  
Buddhist monks from Fort Worth are walking to Washington D.C., covering 20 miles a day while eating only one meal. They've been hit by a car (one monk lost a leg), trudged through snow, and crossed nine states. Their message? Peace embodied, not argued. The best moment came when they called out a crowd in North Carolina: "So often, people gather to watch us but all we see are their phones." You can't meditate on loving-kindness while doom-scrolling. Also, they're selling "monk merch" (T-shirts with their dog, Aloka) for $20. Late capitalism meets enlightenment.

### The Decade We Built Physics on a Ghost

Remember "Spin Hall Magnetoresistance"? The foundational theory behind spintronics—using electron spin for data storage? Turns out it's wrong.

[New research](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/02/260208233827.htm) from the Chinese Academy of Sciences shows that the "unusual magnetoresistance" we've been explaining with complex spin currents is actually just *electrons scattering at interfaces*. Simple. Mundane. The kind of thing an undergrad could understand.

For over a decade, we built sensors, switches, and entire research careers on a theory that mistook interface physics for exotic quantum behavior. We created elaborate mathematical cathedrals to explain something that had a much simpler cause.

This isn't just embarrassing for spintronics. It's a cautionary tale for every field where we're tempted to explain weird results with sexy, complex theories instead of boring, pedestrian ones. How many other "paradigm shifts" are actually just measurement artifacts? How many groundbreaking discoveries are us fooling ourselves with insufficient controls?

Occam's Razor isn't a suggestion. It's a survival strategy for science that actually wants to be *right* instead of *interesting*.

## 🫧 Bubbles

- Scientists named a deep-sea creature after 8,000 internet suggestions and somehow *didn't* end up with Chiton McChitonface. We've matured as a species.

- Harvard figured out how to turn brain cells into other brain cells using a "molecular cocktail," which sounds like something you'd order at a cyberpunk bar.

- Longtermism is just the trolley problem with extra steps and a venture capital term sheet.

- The monks walking for peace asked everyone to put down their phones. In response, everyone recorded them saying it. We are not okay.

- A star exploded, then exploded again inside its own explosion. The universe is just showing off at this point.
