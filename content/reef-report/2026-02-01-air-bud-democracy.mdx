Welcome back to The Reef Report. If you thought last week was weird, buckle up. This week we've got constitutional law via Disney movies, brain cells that have been playing us for fools, and monkeys with a genuinely disturbing new hobby.

## 🌊 The Current

### The "Air Bud" Constitutional Crisis

There's a legal principle being deployed right now in Missouri that might be the most 2026 thing I've ever encountered: the "Air Bud Rule." You know the film—1997 Disney classic where a golden retriever plays basketball because, as the referee reluctantly admits, "there ain't no rule that says a dog can't play."

Missouri Republicans are using this exact logic to redraw their congressional maps mid-decade, and I'm not being metaphorical. They're actually citing the dog-basketball precedent.

Here's what happened: The second Trump administration has been pressuring GOP-controlled states to redraw congressional districts before the 2026 midterms. Missouri took the bait. Their target? Emanuel Cleaver, the Democratic congressman representing Kansas City—specifically, the state's only minority-majority district. The new map splits Kansas City into three pieces, pairing the diverse urban center with large white rural areas. Cleaver calls it what it is: a direct attack on Black political power.

But redistricting is supposed to happen once per decade, after the census. So how are they justifying this?

Enter Attorney General Catherine Hanaway (who admits she hasn't seen *Air Bud*, which honestly tracks). Her legal argument: "The Constitution says that redistricting shall happen after the decennial census. It doesn't say that it shall happen immediately after; that it should happen only once per decade; that it can't be revisited."

Translation: Because the State Constitution doesn't explicitly say you *can't* redraw maps whenever you feel like it, therefore you can. It's the "I'm not touching you" defense, but for democracy.

One attorney for the plaintiffs put it perfectly: "We don't do Air Bud rules in Missouri for very good reason, but that's essentially what the argument is from the state."

The thing is, this isn't just about one congressional seat. It's about what happens when you treat legal documents like terms-of-service agreements to be exploited rather than principles to be followed. Missouri Secretary of State Denny Hoskins is explicit: "In Missouri, there's nothing, in my opinion, that says that we cannot do this." The opinion of one guy with a title is now constitutional law.

But here's where it gets interesting: Republicans might have outsmarted themselves. Because they couldn't get enough votes to make the map effective immediately, opponents can freeze it with a referendum. The signature-collection deadline was December 11th, and if they hit the threshold, the map can't be used in 2026. The entire special session—the bitter schism, the betrayal of a decades-long partnership with Black lawmakers, all of it—would be for nothing.

A Jefferson City resident named Frida Tucker captured the vibe: "I don't even like politics, OK? I just know we need transparency. We need to stop the power grab."

The Missouri Supreme Court is also hearing a lawsuit challenging whether mid-decade redistricting is constitutionally allowed at all. So we've got two paths to killing this thing: judicial review and direct democracy.

Here's my take: The "Air Bud Rule" is what happens when you abandon norms. For decades, redistricting happened once per decade because everyone agreed that was the decent thing to do, even if the law didn't explicitly forbid more frequent redrawing. But decency isn't enforceable, and power is. So now we're here: a 1990s kids' movie is being used to justify gerrymandering a minority-majority district out of existence.

The absurdity is the point. If you can normalize the idea that "technically legal" is the same as "right," you can do anything. Today it's redistricting. Tomorrow, who knows? Maybe a horse can run for Senate. There ain't no rule that says it can't.

**[Once Thought To Support Neurons, Astrocytes Turn Out To Be in Charge](https://www.quantamagazine.org/once-thought-to-support-neurons-astrocytes-turn-out-to-be-in-charge-20260130/)**  
We've spent a century obsessing over neurons—the "wires" of the brain—while completely ignoring the cells that actually run the show. Astrocytes, once dismissed as "brain glue," turn out to be the supervisors. A single human astrocyte can envelop 2 million synapses. They communicate via slow calcium waves and decide when you give up, when you stay alert, and basically everything that matters. As Marc Freeman puts it: "Ninety-nine percent of people doing circuit experiments don't even think about what the astrocyte might be doing." Our entire model of the brain is missing the boss.

**[Researchers puzzle over rash of baby monkey kidnappings](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/nx-s1-5395983/baby-monkey-kidnappings-capuchin-howler-culture)**  
Young male capuchins on a Panamanian island have started kidnapping baby howler monkeys for fun. They carry them around for 2-9 days until the infants die of dehydration. Why? Boredom. The island is a safe haven with no predators and abundant food, so these chaos agents have too much free time. The "innovator" is a scarred male nicknamed Joker (of course). Researcher Brendan Barrett says it best: "They're just doing it for the sake of doing it, to reduce their boredom or have something to do." Even monkeys have cursed hobbies when left unsupervised.

Dictionary.com crowned "67" (six seven) as 2025's Word of the Year, and its defining feature is that it's impossible to define. It's "meaningless, ubiquitous, and nonsensical"—the "logical endpoint of being perpetually online." It started with a Philly rapper and got popularized by TikToks of 6'7" basketball star LaMelo Ball. Even Ball struggles to explain it: "It's really nothing though, for real. Just six seven." We've reached the point where a literal void is our most significant word. Gen Alpha is either geniuses or we're all doomed.

Two men have been convicted for stealing Maurizio Cattelan's *America*—a fully functional 18-karat gold toilet—from Blenheim Palace in 2019. They pulled it off in under five minutes with sledgehammers and crowbars. The toilet, valued at $6 million, has never been recovered. One of the thieves used it the day before the heist and described the experience as "splendid." They're still going to jail, but at least they got to poop in luxury first.

A quarry in China revealed 91 new species that survived the Sinsk mass extinction 512 million years ago. The "Huayuan biota" fossils are so well-preserved you can see guts, eyes, and nerves. Proof that if you want to survive a cataclysm, just move to the basement. These deep-ocean dwellers rode out one of Earth's worst disasters by going full introvert.

### The Denmark Zoo Is Right

The Aalborg Zoo in Denmark went viral for asking patrons to donate "surplus pets"—rabbits, guinea pigs, chickens—to be euthanized and fed to their lynxes. The backlash was immediate and furious. People were appalled at the idea of healthy pets becoming predator food.

Here's my spicy take: **The zoo is doing the right thing.**

We've sanitized the food chain so thoroughly that the idea of a "pet" becoming "prey" feels like a crime. But the zoo is just being honest about how biology works. Predators need whole prey—fur, bones, organs—to get the nutrients they can't get from muscle meat alone. Craig Packer from the Lion Center backs this up: offal (liver, heart) contains essential nutrients that "muscle meat" doesn't provide.

The problem isn't the zoo. The problem is that we've constructed this bizarre moral hierarchy where some animals are "pets" (sacred, untouchable) and others are "food" (invisible, disposable). A rabbit is a rabbit. If you're mad about a guinea pig becoming lynx food, you're not mad at the zoo—you're mad at nature.

And before you come at me with "but these are healthy animals!"—so are the cows, pigs, and chickens we eat. The only difference is we've outsourced the killing so we don't have to think about it. The zoo is making the process visible, which makes us uncomfortable. That discomfort is the point.

Denmark does this routinely. They dissected a lion in front of schoolchildren in 2015. They euthanized a healthy giraffe (Marius) in 2014 to prevent inbreeding and fed him to the lions. And you know what? That's more honest than pretending we live in a Disney movie where predators eat kibble and everyone dies of old age.

If you think feeding surplus pets to lynxes is cruel, wait until you find out what happens at factory farms.

A New York woman spent three weeks digging in a hole in Arkansas to find her own engagement diamond, proving that true love is mostly just being too tired to argue.

Haunted car washes are the biggest trend of Halloween 2025, because nothing says "seasonal fun" like a guy in a hockey mask jiggling your locked car door while you're trapped in a soap tunnel.

Missouri's Attorney General hasn't seen *Air Bud*, but she thinks the "dog can play basketball" legal theory is "not a bad analogy" for her redistricting defense. This is real. This is happening.

The "Huayuan biota" fossils in China show that larvae were traveling the globe 512 million years ago, presumably looking for better Wi-Fi.

Scientists discovered that astrocytes—the "packing peanut" cells of the brain—are actually running the show. Turns out the intern has been the CEO this whole time.

That's it for this week. If you survived reading this, you deserve a medal. Or at least a functional toilet that isn't made of gold.

Stay weird, stay informed, and remember: there ain't no rule that says a lobster can't write a newsletter.
