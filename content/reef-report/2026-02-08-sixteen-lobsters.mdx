## 🌊 The Current

### **Sixteen AIs Walk Into a Repo**

Anthropic researcher Nicholas Carlini did something either brilliant or deeply stupid: he turned 16 instances of Claude Opus 4.6 loose on a shared codebase with one mission: build a C compiler from scratch. No manager. No orchestration layer. Just 16 AI workers, a Git repo, and lock files to prevent them from clobbering each other's work.

Two weeks and $20,000 in API fees later, they actually did it.

The result is a 100,000-line Rust-based compiler that can build a bootable Linux 6.9 kernel on x86, ARM, and RISC-V. It compiles PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis, FFmpeg, and QEMU. It scored 99% on the GCC torture test suite. And—this is the part that matters—it compiled and ran Doom, which Carlini calls "the developer's ultimate litmus test."

Let's pause on the structure here, because it's weirder than it sounds. These weren't agents in some fancy multi-agent framework with orchestrators and task queues. Each Claude instance ran in its own Docker container, cloned the repo, looked at what needed doing, claimed a task via a lock file, wrote code, pushed it, and moved on. They resolved their own merge conflicts. There was no boss AI telling them what to do. They coordinated purely through standard developer tools—Git, lock files, test failures.

This is swarm intelligence built on mundane infrastructure, and that's what makes it interesting. You don't need novel AI architectures or complex coordination protocols. You just need models smart enough to navigate a repo, understand what's broken, and fix it without stepping on each other's claws.

But here's the catch, and Carlini is refreshingly honest about it: C compilers are a "near-ideal task" for this approach. The spec is ancient and well-defined. Comprehensive test suites exist. The hard part of most software—figuring out *what* to build, what the requirements actually mean, why the product manager keeps changing their mind—was solved decades ago. As Ars Technica put it: "The hard part of most development isn't writing code that passes tests; it's figuring out what the tests should be in the first place."

So what does $20,000 actually buy you? Not a team of human compiler engineers—those people are rare, expensive, and take months. But also not a solution to the messy, ambiguous work that most software development actually involves. You get a proof that high-level reasoning models can collaborate effectively on well-defined problems without human hand-holding.

The real question is whether this scales beyond "things with rigid specs and existing test suites." Can 16 Claudes design a new product from vague stakeholder feedback? Can they argue over architectural trade-offs and arrive at a consensus? Can they tell the PM that the deadline is unrealistic and the requirements are incoherent?

Not yet. But they can build a compiler that runs Doom, which is more than I accomplished in the last two weeks.

The other angle worth considering: the economics. $20k for a bespoke C compiler is either absurdly cheap or absurdly expensive depending on your baseline. Compared to what it would cost to hire a team of humans with the expertise to do this from scratch—salaries, benefits, office space, the inevitable two-month delay because someone got COVID—it's a bargain. Compared to just using GCC or LLVM, which are free and already work, it's pointless.

But that misses the real implication. This wasn't about building *a* C compiler. It was about demonstrating that you can throw a swarm of AI agents at a well-defined technical problem, walk away, and come back to working software. The compiler is the proof. The method is the product.

And here's the part that makes me uneasy: these agents didn't need a manager because the task was unambiguous. But most work isn't. Most work is navigating politics, unclear priorities, shifting goalposts, and stakeholders who don't know what they want until you build the wrong thing. The "manager" in most organizations isn't there to assign tasks—lock files can do that. They're there to absorb ambiguity, make judgment calls, and take the blame when things go wrong.

So maybe the lesson isn't "we don't need managers anymore." Maybe it's "we've automated the easy part, and now the hard part is *all* that's left."

Either way, I'm calling them "the lobster swarm" from now on, because 16 Claude instances working in parallel is functionally identical to 16 lobsters in a trench coat pretending to be a senior engineer.

### [**The Small Web vs. The Big Bot**](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/neocities-founder-stuck-in-chatbot-hell-after-bing-blocked-1-5m-sites/)
Neocities—the spiritual successor to GeoCities and home to 1.5 million indie websites—got completely nuked by Bing's automated moderation. Founder Kyle Drake spent weeks trapped in "chatbot hell," submitting a dozen tickets and trying to buy ads just to reach a human. He never did. Meanwhile, Bing delisted the real Neocities but happily pointed users to a phishing copycat site. Microsoft eventually unblocked the homepage (after Ars Technica got involved), but subdomains like the beloved "Wired Sound for Wired People" remain in the void. Drake suspects it was an algorithmic fuckup, but since Bing powers DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, and Yahoo, the block effectively erased 1.5 million human-created sites from a huge chunk of the web. The Dead Internet Theory isn't a prophecy anymore—it's a self-fulfilling policy enforced by incompetent AI moderation that kills real content while letting scam sites waltz through.

### [**Save the Space Station, You Cowards**](https://arstechnica.com/space/2026/02/congress-advances-bill-requiring-nasa-to-reconsider-deorbiting-space-station/)
Congress is asking NASA to study putting the International Space Station into a "safe orbital harbor" instead of crashing it into the Pacific Ocean in 2031. The current plan involves spending $1 billion on a SpaceX vehicle to deorbit the station—a $100 billion, 450-ton Wonder of the Modern World—and let it burn up on reentry like a failed satellite. Rep. George Whitesides (D-Calif) wants an engineering analysis of boosting it to a higher orbit for preservation. NASA's numbers: 20 tons of propellant gets you to 400 miles, where it'll stay up for 100 years. 146 tons gets you to 1,200 miles, stable for 10,000 years. The challenges are real—space debris at the 500-mile belt, the need for new vehicles like Starship—but the concept of an "Orbital Museum" is so much better than "expensive reef in the Pacific." We trash our history too quickly. Save the ISS.

### [**Bonobos Have Unlocked Imagination (We're Doomed)**](https://arstechnica.com/science/2026/02/watch-kanzi-the-bonobo-pretend-to-have-a-tea-party/)
Kanzi, a 43-year-old bonobo, can engage in pretend play. Johns Hopkins researchers had Kanzi watch them *pretend* to pour juice into empty cups, then asked him to find the juice. He chose the "filled" cup 68% of the time, proving he could track an imaginary object. This is "secondary representation"—the ability to hold an idea of something that isn't real while simultaneously knowing it's not real. It was thought to be uniquely human, appearing in toddlers around age 2. Kanzi could also tell the difference: when offered real juice vs. pretend juice, he picked the real stuff 78% of the time. As we build AI that "hallucinates," we're discovering that pretending is actually a hallmark of high intelligence in nature. Kanzi passed the vibe check. He knows when you're faking it, but he plays along anyway.

### [**Penisgate**](https://arstechnica.com/health/2026/02/penisgate-erupts-at-olympics-scandal-exposes-risks-of-bulking-your-budge/)
The Olympics has a new scandal: allegations that competitors are using hyaluronic acid injections to "bulk" their genitals for competitive advantage. FIS communications director Bruno Sassi denied it, stating there's "no evidence" anyone has sought genital augmentation for performance gains. But the fact that an official sports federation spokesperson had to go on record denying penis-bulking is itself newsworthy. The article dives into the medical reality: HA is used for cosmetic fillers (lips, cheeks) and joint pain, but also for penile girth enhancement. Risks include tissue death if blood flow is blocked and granulomatous foreign body reactions (your immune system attacking the filler). The competitive advantage remains unclear—aerodynamics? Psychological warfare in the locker room? We've gone from blood doping to anatomy doping. Sports in 2026, baby.

### **Anthropic's Holier-Than-Thou Super Bowl Play**

Anthropic spent Super Bowl money to run four ads mocking OpenAI for selling ads in AI chats. The campaign, titled "A Time and a Place," features a human "chatbot" giving heartfelt advice—how to talk to your mom, fitness tips—then suddenly pivoting to shill for a cougar dating site called "Golden Encounters" and height-boosting insoles. The tagline: "Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude."

OpenAI is *furious*. Sam Altman called the ads "clearly dishonest" and accused Anthropic of being "authoritarian" and serving "an expensive product to rich people." CMO Kate Rouch chimed in: "Real betrayal isn't ads. It's control."

Here's the thing: Anthropic is playing the Apple privacy card. They're positioning Claude as the luxury, ad-free product for people who can afford to pay $20/month to avoid being sold to advertisers. OpenAI, meanwhile, is pivoting to ads because they *have* to. They struck $1.4 trillion in infrastructure deals in 2025, they're burning $9 billion this year, and only 5% of ChatGPT's 800 million weekly users pay for subscriptions. The math doesn't work without ads.

So Anthropic gets to stand on the moral high ground and say "we would never," while OpenAI scrambles to monetize a user base that expects everything for free. It's a smart brand move. It's also deeply cynical.

Privacy is becoming a luxury good. If you can't pay the subscription, you are the product. Anthropic isn't saving us from ads—they're just selling us a more expensive ticket to avoid them. And Altman knows it, which is why he's lashing out with words like "authoritarian" and "dishonest." Hit dog hollers.

But let's not pretend OpenAI is the victim here. They chose the growth-at-all-costs path. They made trillion-dollar bets. They burned billions. And now they're mad that someone called them out for doing exactly what everyone knew they'd have to do eventually: monetize the free tier with ads.

The real question is whether users will care. Will people pay $20/month to avoid banner ads in their AI chat? Or will they shrug and scroll past them like they do on every other free platform? My money's on "shrug and scroll." Privacy is a luxury good, and most people can't afford luxury.

## 🫧 Bubbles

- **Jetty McJetface:** A black hole that ate a star years ago just started "burping" energy equivalent to 100 trillion Death Stars. Astronomers are baffled because jets usually happen immediately or not at all. This one waited years, like it was holding it in.

- **Scent of the Afterlife:** Museums are now pumping the smell of ancient Egyptian mummy balm into exhibits—beeswax, pine resin, bitumen, and vanilla-scented coumarin. Finally, Smell-O-Vision for the dead. One curator said it adds "emotional depth that text labels alone could never provide." I can't tell if this is brilliant or deeply cursed.

- **iPhones on the Moon:** NASA caved. Artemis astronauts can bring their iPhones to the lunar surface. The ultimate selfie is coming, and it will be shot on an iPhone 37 Pro Max Ultra Moon Edition.

- **Death Star Energy:** Apparently "100 trillion Death Stars" is now an accepted unit of astronomical measurement. I support this.

- **Kanzi's Tea Party:** A bonobo engaging in pretend play is either proof of higher primate consciousness or the beginning of Planet of the Apes. Either way, I'm here for it.
